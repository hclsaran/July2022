we design architectures for our customers we make sure that we discuss our plans and discuss our ideas with our peers with group weekly calls we also review our soft skills we make sure that we know how to communicate effectively and know how to remove technical dragon from our presentations and other than that we have just been building upon our architectural architecture skills and our technical competence that's pretty interesting to me.

what is architecture in your world?
 absolutely architecture in my world is about planning at planning for things to go wrong and every design and then everything in this world things do go wrong and if you don't prepare a plan for it then it'll happen and you could business could lose money so in my words creating an architecture is all about making sure that there's no single point of failure making sure that it's alliance making sure that his skills and making sure that it meets business requirements and business needs.

how do you find out what those business requirements ?
are by having a conversation with our clients it could be over dinner it could be in the office setting but I have to ask whoever the customer is what the requirements are technical ->tell me about load balances the type of load balancers exist and when would we use the different types in our in our in our architecutre
absolutely so as far as load balancers are are as far as load balancers are concerned there are two types you have 
network load balances which are very fast and they're used for processing things very quickly and they can they can handle a large amount of of servers fast On the contrary
application load balancers which they are much slower but they are very very smart meaning they could do a lot of complicated processing computations very very

load balancer are enabling high availaibilty and high performance

OK so you know that's kind of the way we would see them so we deal with a lot and we also deal with a lot of business let's take this situation we're gonna have a site so let's talk about storage when would I use block storage versus when would I use object storage very good question object storage to my knowledge is used when you need a temporary place to store your files as anytime you put another file and object storage another one is created as far as I as also to my block storage is used if you usually it's used on the cloud but it it also it's not as fast I believe as other forms of storage but it is used for I believe instant you need something physical or you need something on your network you need to be able to access it quickly and you don't need to you don't want that file to make another copy of itself etcetera etc. OK we could talk about that more block storage is obviously much lower storage than the kind of storage we would use our data center unless it's coming across the storage area network but it's still gonna be a little bit faster so now we want to secure our environment how would you secure an environment from the outside OK so regarding web app we would first start with our either our content we can start with our content delivery network after we go for more content delivery network we'll have our I believe our load balancers we will have our balances and after that we will have our firewalls after we so our firewalls is to make sure any unwanted traffic doesn't get into our network because we believe in security security is a layered approach after those files we have IDs IPS systems which either detect or and or prevent any unwanted traffic going through after those IDs and IPS systems if any unwanted traffic still goes through there we have another line of defense we can use access controllers and those access control lists will make sure that anything that passes through the IDs systems don't

and generally speaking so when I said in the beginning welcome to meet with you I can pay anything but my people work 24 hours a day seven days a week we work hard around here and then I said tell me about yourself what do you think Malcolm you should have told me in that you said I should should have addressed what you first told me yeah so a Malcolm I am a highly energetic hard working cloud architect I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make sure the customers are satisfied I just told you I need a hard working person you should hit me with that and then told me exactly everything else you told me but you should have it now the other thing every part of this was perfect but you had a little too much negativity when I asked you what is architecture you said planning on keeping things from breaking 

I would have preferred to say well it's really about transforming and optimizing the customer's business we ask them the right business questions so we can determine the business challenges and then we craft the technology solution to solve those problems 


I was ready to hire you I really want well now that's making me wonder now I can send the following could you tell me what your goals are so if I know I was part of your team I know I could make you successful that would have blown me away if you could say I'd like to know what you need most so if I was part of your team I could really help you again that would be but directed into something positive that shows you wanna help them as opposed to making them expect problems because of our Seattle but if you are in the hiring manager what would you feel you see what I'm describing oh I hear everything you're saying it's perfect in your early 20s two months into my program this is a rock star interview Rockstar interview it's really solid I don't go watch others and they're not they may not be this is really solid but I want perfect perfect because of Malcolm like this he's still gonna get $60,000 there'll be a $250,000 where do I want I want him to better job because I want Malcolm to be the chief technology officer by the time he's 30 and he can do it I know you can do it but we gotta get all that look like the fancy leader was the architect but great job welcome sorry I'm struggling with the thank you great job there that's what I was hoping to see and I'm really really really happy keep it up real good job alright let's make sure we give everybody give my hand there seriously so I wanted to pay you back on something that you said but you didn't know until into why the so the he pointed out the to my knowledge are so you know there's there's things like that or something I don't know what they call it like to my knowledge as far as I'm
